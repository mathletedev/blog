title: "Rust's Result Enum: The GOAT of Error Handling"
date: "2024-08-02"
---

When I first started learning Rust, one of the things that bugged me was the `Result` enum.
I found my codebase riddled with chains of `unwrap()`s and `expect()`s,
while `rustfmt` desperately tried to parse the madness.
Everything looked so verbose; why couldn't I just let functions error out?

At the time, I was an avid TypeScript programmer, so I was stuck in the land of `try...catch`.
I wasn't a fan of error handling. My thought process was, "If I code everything right, _there will be no errors_".
If I was unsure about something, I would just throw a `try` block around the adjacent 10 lines and call it a day.

> Error handling, am I right?

As I started shifting my focus towards full-stack development, I began to realise the holes in this ideology.
When you have a state for every entity that gets passed between client and server, it gets real messy.
Let's say you have a method on your server, `getMyPosts()`. Simple enough.
Server returns a list of `Post`s, client renders said posts, user is happy.

However, what if the user isn't logged in? We can't return the user's posts if he/she isn't authenticated.
We have 3 basic ways of handling this:

1.  Return an empty list. Problem is, how do we differentiate between _user is unauthenticated_ vs _user has no posts_?
2.  Return `null` or `undefined`.
    This is better, but now we're uncertain between _user is unauthenticated_ vs _error retrieving posts_
    (assuming we're not returning an HTTP error code).
3.  Return an additional field, `error?: string`, containing a description for the error.
    This causes a lot of mental gymnastics, as we now need to consider this possible error field with every request,
    not to mention the chore of making the strings consistent throughout the entire codebase.

Is there no better way of solving this issue?

# The compiler assignment

While I was learning the ropes of Rust,
I was also taking a C++ data structures class at my local university (shoutout Andy O'Fallon the 🐐).
Towards the end of the year, we had an assignment for writing a tiny compiler for the
[Simple BASIC](https://www.cs.uaf.edu/~cs202/deitel4e/ab2eocexample.html#:~:text=The%20Simpletron%20runs%20programs%20written%20in%20the%20only,in%20calculations%20or%20examines%20it%20in%20various%20ways.)
language, along with a simulator for Simple Machine Language, known as the [Simpletron](https://web.cs.wpi.edu/~jburge/courses/c01/cs2011/lectures/lecture5.pdf).
I'd heard many people praise Rust's string handling, so I decided to give it a whirl with this assignment.

To say I was amazed by Rust's error handling is an understatement.
I came into this project trying to escape from C++ strings,
but ended up falling in love with functional programming and errors as values.
When writing a compiler, you have to keep track of many moving pieces.
Think of the error states possible: Syntax errors, mathematical errors (dividing by 0), parametric errors, etc.

Now imagine keeping track of these states with the aforementioned `error?`. That's gonna be a lot of strings.

# Rust's Result enum

With Rust, we get a `Result` enum out-of-the-`Box`:

```rs
enum Result<T, E> {
    Ok(T),
    Err(E),
}
```

This looks really simple, but it's also really cool.

Essentially, a `Result` can contain either an `Ok` value **or** an `Err` value, but not **both**.
To get the `Ok` value, you have to extract it intentionally. What do I mean by this?

Let's say I have a result variable. I cannot simply extract the `Ok` value:

```rs
let res: Result<i32, String> = Ok(100);

if res == 200 {} // this won't compile
```

Instead, I must extract it with _intent_, like so:

```rs
// just extract ok value
if let Ok(v) = res {
    if v == 200 {
        println!("Ok: {v}");
    }
}

// also handle error
match res {
    Ok(v) => println!("Ok: {v}"),
    Err(e) => println!("Error: {e}"),
};

// or simply discarding the error (aka trust me bro)
let v = res.unwrap();

// even with a question mark?
let v = res?;
```

You'll see this littered throughout my Simple codebase, and it made my life so much easier during this assignment.

```rs
let file = match File::open(&in_path) {
    Ok(file) => file,
    Err(_) => {
        println!(
            "*** Failed to open file {} for reading ***",
            &in_path.to_string_lossy()
        );
        return;
    }
};
```

Intent is important here, because it forces the programmer to consider the _possibility_ of an error.
Although this can be a little tedious,
it is an excellent trade-off for the massively improved structure and organisation of a codebase.

# Conclusion

After the compiler assignment, I have come to understand how amazing `unwrap()` and `match` are.
Errors as values reduce confusion, allowing one to "trace" an error as it _bubbles up_ through function calls,
rather than let it blindly `throw` into the void.
When a language natively implements a feature like the `Result` enum,
it becomes a common standard that is shared across all codebases, improving code quality and readability everywhere.
